PISCENE_C
C Programming

For the next month, I will be dedicating myself to completing the C_Piscene from 42-University.
Everyday I will do a series of exercises. These exercises are structures in weekly segments of 5
Day challenges from Monday to Friday, 1 4hour exam, a weekend project, and a group project
(Which I will be doing by myself)
Every day I will upload the activities for that day, and at the end of the weekend I will upload both
the Solo, and the Team challenges.


Inside of each Daily challenge’s repository, you will find:
A PDF document outlining the challenges and its objectives for that day
A ReadMe file with instructions on how to compile and run the projects
The source code for each challenge, with comments to describe it’s functional processes


NOTE:

To test the activities, you will need to create your own main function, and use this function
to call the functions from the activity you want to test.
To compile the project, simply run:
gcc main.c <Path-To-Activity-Function-You-Wish-To-Test>

An after the compilation is complete, an output file will be created. To run this program you will
run the following command in your terminal window, using the output file generated after
compilation:
• ./a.out
