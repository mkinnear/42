HOW TO CREATE A MAIN FUNCTION:

NOTE: before writing your main function. Include the path to the header file

Example:

#include “day01/includes/day01.h”

Int	main(void)
{
	// variables necessary to pass to the function in the activity you wish to test

	// function call for the activity you wish to test

	return (0);
}


HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN THE PROGRAM:

Compiling the program:
gcc <path to main.c> <path to activity.c>

Example:
	gcc main.c day01/ex00/ft_ft.c


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:

Running the program:

Within the same directory you used to compile the program, us the following command:
./a.out

Example:

gcc main.c day01/ex00/ft_ft.c
./a.out
